# Product Requirements Document: Host Outbound Network Traffic Monitor

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a GUI application that monitors host outbound network traffic. The application will track destinations, data volume, and map this information to geographical locations, domain names, and network providers.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide users with a clear and intuitive way to monitor their computer's outbound network traffic.
*   Identify the geographic location of network traffic destinations.
*   Resolve destination IP addresses to domain names and network providers.
*   Visualize network traffic data in a user-friendly manner.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Traffic Monitoring

*   Capture all outbound network packets from the host machine.
*   Record the destination IP address, port, and the volume of data sent.
*   Display a real-time view of network connections.

### 3.2. Geolocation

*   Use a geolocation database to map destination IP addresses to countries and cities.
*   Display traffic destinations on a world map.

### 3.3. Domain and Provider Resolution

*   Perform reverse DNS lookups to identify the domain names associated with destination IP addresses.
*   Identify the network provider (ASN) for each destination IP address.

### 3.4. Data Visualization

*   Display a summary of network traffic, including total data volume and the number of connections.
*   Provide a searchable and sortable list of all network connections.
*   Use charts and graphs to visualize data, such as traffic by country or by application.

### 3.5. User Interface

*   A clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
*   A main dashboard displaying key information at a glance.
*   Detailed views for exploring specific connections and data points.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The application should have a low impact on system performance.
*   **Accuracy:** Geolocation and domain name resolution should be as accurate as possible.
*   **Security:** The application must not compromise the security of the host system.
*   **Platform:** The initial version will be for Windows, with potential for future cross-platform support.
